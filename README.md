On Android in Chrome there are no errors, everything works correctly.

On iPhone SE 1st, iOS 15.8.1 in Chrome and Safari an error often occurs in a specific situation.

If I go from the news page to the about page and back several times, an error appears that I cannot debug. After it, GET requests stop working.

If you comment out GET requests, there is no error. If you remove ngx-scanner-qrcode, then there is no error either.

Can you tell me where I should look to fix this?
